 * @description
 * Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]
 * such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
 *
 * Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
 *
 * @example
 * Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
 * Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
 *
 * @example
 * Input: nums = [0,1,1]
 * Output: []
 *
 * @example
 * Input: nums = [0,0,0]
 * Output: [[0,0,0]]

// APPROACH
// =================================================================================================
/**
 * The problem asks for unique triplets that sum to zero. A brute-force approach would be to use
 * three nested loops, which would result in an O(n^3) time complexity. We can optimize this
 * significantly by using a two-pointer technique after sorting the array.
 *
 * The Two-Pointer Approach:
 *
 * 1.  **Sort the Array**: The first and most crucial step is to sort the input array `nums`.
 * This allows us to easily handle duplicates and use the two-pointer method efficiently.
 *
 * 2.  **Iterate with a Primary Pointer**: We loop through the sorted array with a single pointer `i`.
 * The element `nums[i]` will be the first number in our potential triplet.
 *
 * 3.  **Skip Duplicates for the First Element**: To ensure the final result contains unique triplets,
 * we must handle duplicates. If our current element `nums[i]` is the same as the previous
 * element `nums[i-1]`, it means we have already processed all possible triplets for this
 * number. So, we skip the current iteration to avoid duplicate work and results.
 *
 * 4.  **Two-Pointer Sub-problem**: For each `nums[i]`, our goal is to find two other numbers in the
 * rest of the array (from index `i+1` to the end) that sum up to `-nums[i]`. This is a
 * classic "Two Sum" problem on a sorted array.
 *
 * 5.  **Initialize Pointers**: We initialize a `left` pointer at `i + 1` and a `right` pointer
 * at the end of the array (`nums.length - 1`).
 *
 * 6.  **Move Pointers Inward**: We move the `left` and `right` pointers toward each other based on
 * the sum of the current triplet (`nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]`):
 * - If `sum === 0`: We've found a valid triplet. We add it to our result list. Then, to
 * avoid duplicate triplets from the same `nums[i]`, we must skip any duplicate values
 * for `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` before continuing the search.
 * - If `sum < 0`: The sum is too small. To increase it, we need a larger number, so we
 * increment the `left` pointer.
 * - If `sum > 0`: The sum is too large. To decrease it, we need a smaller number, so we
 * decrement the `right` pointer.
 *
 * 7.  **Termination**: The inner `while` loop continues until `left` and `right` pointers cross,
 * at which point we move to the next element `nums[i]` in the outer loop.

// =================================================================================================
// TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY
// =================================================================================================
/**
 * Time Complexity: O(n^2)
 * - The initial sort of the array takes O(n log n) time.
 * - The main `for` loop runs up to `n-2` times. Inside it, the `while` loop with the two
 * pointers (`left` and `right`) runs at most `n` times for each `i`. This nested loop
 * structure gives us a complexity of O(n^2).
 * - Since O(n^2) is dominant over O(n log n), the total time complexity is O(n^2).
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(log n) or O(n)
 * - This depends on the space complexity of the sorting algorithm implemented in the
 * JavaScript/TypeScript runtime. Timsort (used in V8/Node.js) or Mergesort can take
 * O(n) space, while Quicksort might take O(log n) on average.
 * - If we exclude the space required for the output array `result`, the space complexity
 * is dominated by the sort. If we include it, the space could be larger, but it's
 * standard practice to analyze the auxiliary space used by the algorithm itself.
